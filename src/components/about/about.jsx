            to stay home and raise his daughter Fiadh. Shortly there-after, he returned to the workforce 
            at Towson Universitry, working in the facilities department as a Storekeeper. It was while 
            working at Towson that John decided to return to school to persue his bachelors degree in 
            computer science. Being a full time worker,father and husband, he chose to attend school

            as his previous credits via his associates degree, John was able to push himself to complete 
            his degree in just 2 years of full-time classes. Graduating Magna Cum Laude, John is eager to 
            continue learning in the workforce, where he hopes to continue his education.
